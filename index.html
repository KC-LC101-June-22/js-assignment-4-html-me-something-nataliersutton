         <h1 class="intro" id="home">Games To Play With Friends!</h1>
            <p>Over the last several years we've learned how important it is to stay connected with friends and family even if we can't physically be together. One time tested way to create connections with people is to play games together and our technology today makes that easier than ever to do even if everyone lives across the country, or even across the world, from each other.
            <br><br>
            In order to help more people do so, I've curated a list of online cooperative games available on PC. Cooperative means you'll be working with the other players to accomplish some kind of goal instead of competing against each other. These games are also players versus the environment, which means you're only battling or competing together against the game itself and not other outside players. This setup makes these games all great to test &amp; develop your teamwork skills. I've compiled a list of some of my friend groups favorites from the past year, organized loosely by genre, so you can find what you already know you like or branch out and try out something new!
            <br><br>
            So do you want to start playing games with your friends? Of course you do! Here's a list of online cooperative PC games with something for every friend group!</p>
            <section>
               <h2 id="puzzles">Brain Teasers</h2>
                  <p>Do you and your friends like solving riddles, puzzles, and just generally giving your brain a challenge? If so, take a look at these games that are sure to get you thinking.</p>
                  <h3>Escape Room Simulator</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 4 players</p>
                     <p>Follow the clues and work together to solve the different puzzles and escape the room! This game is just like the real life escape rooms you may have tried, but now you can do so in the comfort of your own home. The game contains multiple levels based around various themes like Ancient Egypt or A Space Station. In addition you can download almost endless extra rooms made by other players or even try your hand at making your own!</p>
                  <h3>Portal 2</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">2 players</p>
                     <p>A follow up to the original Portal game, you can now make your way through new test chambers of Aperature Science Labs as two test bots, run by the occasionally murderous AI GLaDOS, but this time with a friend to help you along the way. You use the same portal guns to create exit and entry points in the rooms, and battle new challenges and lab physics to make it through, while not unscathed, at least reassembled by the end.</p>
                  <h3>Human Fall Flat</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 8 players</p>
                     <p>A silly puzzle platformer, you will attempt to make your way through the various levels using a very floppy and very bouncy avatar that you can customize to your liking. You'll need to use your environment in order to jump, climb, dive, and throw yourself into objects in order to make it to the end. This game also has community generated maps to choose from once you finish the game's main content.</p>

                  <h3>Risk of Rain 2</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 4 players</p>
                     <p>If zombies aren't your style, maybe you'd prefer fighting your way through an alien planet? Challenge giant space monsters while you play as several different classes each with their own abilities and weapons. Collect items while you battle to combine and create new upgrades for your character. This is a rogue-like game which means you'll keep fighting to survive until you reach the final boss, or you can choose to keep playing indefinitely as the game becomes progressively harder.</p>
                  <h3>Borderlands 3</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 4 players</p>
                     <p>Set on a steampunk adjacent space colony, this shooter has you play as a band of treasure seeking mercenaries fighting against a new cult trying to take over the planet. It has a unique comic book art style that makes it even more fun to play. This game is big on collecting new loot, armor, ammo, and weapons every time you fight in order to keep upgrading and progressing your character. With a larger story element and lots of side quests, this one should keep your group busy for quite a while.</p>

                  <h3>Core Keeper</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 8 players</p>
                     <p>Explore a vast underground cavern filled with several different biomes while uncovering the secrets of the Core. Mine your way through the world to build up your subterranean farm. Fight enemies and defeat bosses to unlock new gameplay mechanics and expand your base.

Visually lush, you can build an entire village or sail the seas on viking longships. Try to impress Odin with your creation!</p>
                  <h3>Grounded</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 4 players</p>
                     <p>In "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" type antics, you find yourself shrunken down to miniature size looking at a very different perspective of your backyard. Use natural materials and urban detritus to survive against previously harmless entities like ants, bees, spiders, and birds and build shelters, armor, and weapons to keep yourself safe. Try to make your way home and figure out how to get back to normal size.</p>

            <section>
               <h2 id="horror">Spooky Season</h2>

Using your tools and your wits, try to figure out exactly what kind of apparition you're dealing with and accomplish your objectives to earn extra money from your jobs. Be careful though, investigating the supernatural comes with risks and you might soon get hunted right back and soon become a ghost yourself.</p>
                  <h3>Forewarned</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 4 players</p>
                     <p>If exotic locations and ancient history is more your style, maybe you and your friends would enjoy going on an archeological expedition and searching for buried treasure and valuable artifacts. Watch out, exploring long lost tombs means you might trigger the cursed inhabitants and they are not happy to be awoken. Better get out while you still can!</p>
                  <h3>Killing Floor 2</h3>
                     <p id="mainHeading">1 to 6 players</p>
                     <p>Maybe you'd rather fight back with a little more firepower? If so, you'll be happy to hack and slash your way through the constant hordes of nightmares created from a scientific experiment gone wrong. Humanity is fighting back against the chaos, but will your team be strong enough to make it?</p>
